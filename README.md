# Photolabs

Welcome to PhotoLabs, an app where you can view and like photos! 
You can search by category to find photos that interest you, and if you want to see a photo up close, you can click on it to see a larger version (also known as Modal View).
While in Modal view, you will see suggested photos that you may also like.

Happy Browsing!

This was a project for students to learn and practice React for Lighthouse Labs' Web Development Bootcamp.
